# mission-builder

This Mission-Builder application is a quick web app utilizing a couple 
different technologies as well as the SpaceX API to generate artificial 
launch environments.

When a user clicks on one of the 3 left hand buttons, the application
filters through a few arrays gathering information to display about the
selected category. When the user has all 3 items selected, they are able
to click the launch button which will display a message containing the 
information about the launch. An alert will pop up showing the user which
item they are missing for a succesful launch. Once the container showing
the information for the launch leaves the screen, the user is able to 
begin building out another launch mission.
